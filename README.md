# Platzi Video

Project made in the course "De jQuery a JavaScript" by https://platzi.com/. I practiced JS and acquired many skills 😎. The project fetch data from two public APIs, have a search, a list of random friends and a custom modal for each movie. You can search for any movie in the history of the humanity, thanks to http://omdbapi.com/, and get the year of premiere and the official poster. Enjoy 😁 

Notice: It doesn't have responsive design
